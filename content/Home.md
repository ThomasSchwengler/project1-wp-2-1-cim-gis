# IBPSA Project 1
## City District Information Modeling

This work package addresses urban scale energy performance simulation of 
domestic and non-domestic buildings. Highlighting the exchange requirements 
and country-specific data mapping approaches, the work package also deals with 
archetypal definitions of buildings with respect to the generalization of 
country-specific age-bands, geometrical forms and building functions.
Semantic data enrichment, parsimonious geometric information processing and 
the participation in development of the CityGML schema and EnergyADE for 
specific simulation tools is also emphasized. Considering different modelling 
techniques, generic import-export functionalities and enrichment algorithms,
the team aims to demonstrate the application of the developed workflows for a
range of tools, including Modelica and EnergyPlus, and for a range of 
geographical contexts and application use cases. The GML ToolBox, which 
extends the pre-processing of geometric prerequisites, modelling of thermal 
zones and openings and checks CityGML base standards and ADE conformance 
conditions for dynamic heating and cooling demand simulations in EnergyPlus,
is one such example. Another example is an extension to the TEASER tool that 
is currently being developed to process the five CityGML Levels of Detail and 
Energy ADE information as an input for annual thermal simulation using Modelica.
A further example is the development of a new workflow for the preparation of 
large (thousands to tens of thousands of buildings) urban scenes for simulation
using the CitySim+ urban enery simulation engine. Open source translators and workflows
 for district energy simulations can be recognized as some of the outputs for this work package.
