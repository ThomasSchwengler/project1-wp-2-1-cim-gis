# Data categories

Starting from building level to an urban scale simulation, the amount of required relevant data for energy analysis can differ with respect to the considered data model and/or simulation environment. 
Thus, the data used for such simulations largely vary in resolution, usage and management.
In order to define the data sources, three major data types are identified: 

* Primary = Information that can be directly used in a building simulation (e.g. geometric features)
* Secundary = Classifiers (e.g. building age)
* Tertiary = Statistical information (e.g. building topology)
